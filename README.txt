Dynamic Time Warping Implementation

An implementation of the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm in python with integers input. 

1. Installation

There are 2 text files for the inputs of the code. The first line of each text file is the dimensions (row, column) of each input. The rest of the file are the actual data. 

Make sure you have the latest python version installed on your environment.

Run this command to run the python script

 python3 ./DTW.py "_argument_"

"_argument_" = "-c" if you want to run the cat distance function

"_argument_" = "-e" if you want to run the Euclidean distance function
